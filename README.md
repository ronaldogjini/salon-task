## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm (Node package manager)
- A database (SQLite)

### Architecture

The backend and frontend components of this project are decoupled. This means that they operate independently, allowing for greater flexibility and scalability. You will need to run both the backend and frontend servers individually.
